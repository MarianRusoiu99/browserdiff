# Code Deduplication Opportunities

## Summary
Reviewed codebase for duplicate code patterns. Found minor duplication that could be refactored in future, but does not affect Feature 002 implementation.

## Findings

### 1. Timeout Promise Implementations (Low Priority)
**Location:**
- `src/services/ScreenshotService.ts:127-131` - `timeoutPromise()` method
- `src/core/ParallelExecutor.ts:103-105` - Inline timeout promise

**Recommendation:** 
Both could use `src/utils/Performance.ts:withTimeout()` method which already exists. However, this requires refactoring Promise.race patterns and is not urgent.

**Status:** Documented for future refactoring

### 2. File/Directory Existence Checks (Low Priority)
**Location:**
- `src/utils/FileSystem.ts` - Has `fileExists()` and `directoryExists()` utilities
- `src/utils/directory-utils.ts` - Has duplicate `directoryExists()` and `ensureDirectoryExists()`
- `src/services/ConfigService.ts:93-101` - Has private `fileExists()` method

**Recommendation:** 
ConfigService should import and use `FileSystem.fileExists()` instead of implementing its own. The directory-utils and FileSystem both have `directoryExists()` - should consolidate to one location.

**Status:** Low priority - working correctly, cosmetic improvement

### 3. Delay Functions (Acceptable)
**Location:**
- `src/services/BrowserService.ts:119-121` - Private `delay()` method

**Status:** Only one implementation, no duplication found. âœ“

## Conclusion
No critical duplication found that affects Feature 002. All implementations are working correctly. Future refactoring could consolidate timeout and file existence utilities, but this is not urgent.

## Action Items
- [ ] Future: Refactor ScreenshotService and ParallelExecutor to use Performance.withTimeout()
- [ ] Future: Consolidate file/directory existence checks to FileSystem utility
- [ ] Future: Merge directory-utils and FileSystem utilities if appropriate
