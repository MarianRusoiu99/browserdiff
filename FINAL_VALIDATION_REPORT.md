node dist/src/cli/index.js diff https://example.com \
  --browsers chromium firefox \
  --full-page \
  --max-height 15000 \
  --structured-output \
  --verbose

# Result:
✓ chromium: success (125ms)
✓ firefox: success (103ms)
✓ Report generated
✓ Minor differences within threshold
```

**All CLI Options:** ✅ Recognized and working
