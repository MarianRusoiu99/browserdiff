# Manual Testing Report - Full Page Screenshots Feature

**Test Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Feature:** Full Page Screenshots and Structured Output  
**Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

---

## Test Environment

- **Node.js:** v18+
- **Platform:** Linux (archlinux)
- **Build:** Fresh build from source
- **Test URL:** https://example.com

## Build Fix Applied

### Issue Found
- TypeScript compilation outputs to `dist/src/` not `dist/`
- Templates were being copied to `dist/templates/` but code expected `dist/src/templates/`
- Binary path in package.json was incorrect

### Fix Applied
Updated `package.json`:
```json
"main": "dist/src/index.js",
"bin": { "browserdiff": "./dist/src/cli/index.js" },
"copy:templates": "mkdir -p dist/templates dist/src/templates && cp src/templates/*.ejs dist/templates/ && cp src/templates/*.ejs dist/src/templates/"
```

**Result:** ✅ Build now works correctly
