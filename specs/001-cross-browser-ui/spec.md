# Feature Specification: Cross-Browser UI Diff CLI Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-cross-browser-ui`  
**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A command-line tool that enables developers to test and compare UI rendering across browsers. Runs UI tests on multiple browsers (default: all Playwright-supported). Users can specify which browsers to include via CLI options. Takes screenshots from each browser. Compares results to a baseline reference. Highlights visual differences (diff images). Generates a structured HTML report showing original baseline screenshot, each browser's rendering, and difference overlays or highlights. Reports must be easy to browse and shareable."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to verify that my web application renders consistently across different browsers so that I can ensure a uniform user experience and catch visual regressions before deployment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a web application URL, **When** I run the CLI tool with default settings, **Then** screenshots are captured from all supported browsers and compared against a baseline with differences highlighted in an HTML report.

2. **Given** I want to test specific browsers only, **When** I run the CLI tool with browser selection options, **Then** only the specified browsers are used for testing and comparison.

3. **Given** I have a baseline reference image, **When** I run the tool against a modified version of my application, **Then** visual differences are detected and highlighted in the generated report.

4. **Given** I have completed a cross-browser test run, **When** I open the HTML report, **Then** I can easily navigate between browser results and see clear visual comparisons with difference overlays.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a specified browser is not available on the system?
- How does the system handle network timeouts or page loading failures?
- What occurs when no baseline reference exists for comparison?
- How does the tool behave with responsive designs or dynamic content?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST capture screenshots from multiple browsers for the same web page or application
- **FR-002**: System MUST support all major browsers available through automation frameworks
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to specify which browsers to include in testing via command-line options
- **FR-004**: System MUST compare captured screenshots against a baseline reference image
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate visual difference images highlighting discrepancies between browser renderings
- **FR-006**: System MUST produce an HTML report displaying baseline, browser-specific results, and difference overlays
- **FR-007**: System MUST create reports that are self-contained and shareable without external dependencies
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear navigation within the HTML report for easy browsing
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle cases where no baseline exists by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should it create a new baseline, prompt user, or error?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide meaningful error messages when browsers fail to load or capture content
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to specify target URLs or local file paths for testing
- **FR-012**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what image formats for baseline and output?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Session**: Represents a single execution of cross-browser testing, containing metadata about browsers used, target URL, and timestamp
- **Browser Result**: Contains screenshot data, browser information, and capture metadata for a single browser
- **Baseline Reference**: The reference image used for comparison, with associated metadata about when it was created
- **Difference Report**: Visual comparison data showing detected differences between browser renderings and baseline
- **HTML Report**: Structured output containing all test results, images, and navigation elements for user consumption
